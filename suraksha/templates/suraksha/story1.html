            <p>My dad passed away when I was very young.</p>
            <p>Looking back, that trauma alone was enough to cause me to hide. However, it served as the most common excuse for adults to explain away my anger, rebellion, and withdrawal. I was labeled “the angry one” in my teenage years, so I began to live up to their description.</p>
            <p>It started when I was only five. A little girl who was missing her father, perhaps it made me an easy target. Looking back, I was groomed. Special gifts, secrets, nicknames, ways to be isolated and alone with him… He would threaten to hurt my family. I knew I didn’t like it, but I honestly didn’t realize just how wrong and sick it truly was.</p>
            <p>I look at young children now, and my heart breaks all over again. My innocence was taken at a time when I didn’t even know what it was. I suffered in silence for more than a decade.</p>
            <p>There were times that my life was in danger; my abuser would strangle me until I passed out. Then, he could rape me without resistance. Then, he would give me pills and alcohol when I was only twelve and thirteen years old.</p>
            <p>In 2005, at the age of 15, I tried to commit suicide for the first time. Since then, I have survived two other attempts. During the hospitalization in 2005, I disclosed for the very first time. “I was raped.” I finally told. I was finally brave enough to speak up for myself, and nothing happened.</p>
            <p>After my first attempt to take my life, I confided in a trusted friend. She was only 15 as well, and she was suffering through her own abuse. It was a very unhealthy relationship, but it was the safety we created. We decided we would hurt ourselves instead of allowing him the privilege. It felt like an attempt to self-medicate. We shared our stories and began cutting together, being angry together, and searching to reestablish control that had been taken from us.</p>
            <p>The distraction of my suicide attempt allowed my source of pain to be swept under my depression. Loved ones didn’t know how to talk about it, so they didn’t even try. From that moment forward, I knew healing would have to be my own responsibility.</p>
