        <div class="story">
            <p>I was born in Palestine and moved to England with my mum when I was 8. My mum is a strict Muslim and when I was 13 we started arguing a lot because she didn't want me to go out with my friends..</p>
            <p> She thought that England was really dangerous and she was worried that I'd get into drink and drugs. I felt like I was stuck between two cultures. Soon after, I began running away from home. </p>
<p>"As the arguments with my mum got worse, I started running away for longer, sometimes for up to a month. I'd stay with friends, or boyfriends, or with a stranger. But there were times when I had nowhere to go. I wandered the streets in the middle of the night and I was scared."

</p>
            <p>Sometimes I would stay with strangers and have sex with them. It would be a roof over my head for the night and some food in my belly. I was scared but not scared enough to stop doing it. At the time it was better than having to go home..</p>
            <p> I saw that I was being sexually groomed and that men were taking advantage of me. I thought that I was an adult and I was acting like an adult but I wasn’t one.</p>
            <p>It was nice speaking to other girls who were going through the same thing as me and knew how it felt. I hadn't told any of my friends about what I was doing so they couldn't understand what I was experiencing..</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>After my first attempt to take my life, I confided in a trusted friend. She was only 15 as well, and she was suffering through her own abuse. It was a very unhealthy relationship, but it was the safety we created. We decided we would hurt ourselves instead of allowing him the privilege. It felt like an attempt to self-medicate. We shared our stories and began cutting together, being angry together, and searching to reestablish control that had been taken from us.</p>
