            <p> When I was a little girl, all of the people in my life at that time – the adults, the people that were supposed to be my protectors – they were my abusers. I just couldn’t understand why the people that were supposed to love and care about me and were supposed to be my family, were the people that were hurting me the most, and were the people that wished I was dead. </p>
<p> Chrissy grew up in a city in western Missouri in the 1980s. The ketchup memory is just one of many painful recollections. She experienced unimaginable physical, sexual and emotional abuse at the hands of her biological parents and grandparents.</p>

<p>  She recounts a story when her biological mother held a knife to her neck and almost killed her. She made a split-second decision to run across the street to the neighbor’s house. At the age of 9, the police removed Chrissy and her siblings from their home. “I never wanted to go back,” she said.</p>
     
    <p> A caring couple provided foster care for and then adopted Chrissy and three of her siblings. (She has three more siblings who were also removed from the home. All grew up within 2 miles of each other and stayed connected.) Her adoptive family provided a safe, stable and loving environment. Chrissy succeeded in school, eventually obtaining her master’s degree in social work.

        Today she works in KVC’s Kansas City, Kansas office, supervising a team of case managers who match dozens of children in foster care with loving adoptive families each year. She also works at KVC Prairie Ridge Children’s Psychiatric Hospital, providing therapy to children and teenagers who have mental and behavioral health challenges or have experienced childhood adversity such as abuse or neglect.</p>

<p>She is not only a survivor of child abuse, but is also a thriver. Chrissy works every day as a champion for other children who are in danger.

    “If I was whispering to a child that was experiencing abuse right now, I would tell them they will be rescued and they will overcome this. And I would tell them not to give up, to keep fighting. There are so many children that just need a second chance at life.”</p>
