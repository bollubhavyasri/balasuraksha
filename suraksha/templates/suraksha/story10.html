            <p>My childhood was not a childhood.  In my family, adults raped children.  It was our normal.  It was our culture and it was generational.  My parents grew up with it.  Their parents grew up with it.  The abusers justified their disgusting behavior with excuses and stories.  Most of the victims in our family didn’t remember it because the trauma caused dissociative amnesia.  We were a family of traumatized individuals who were doing whatever it took to survive … usually at the expense of the others. </p>
            <p>The extreme abuse in our family might seem easily discernible to outsiders.  In our case, it wasn’t.  We were a typical suburban family.  We lived in a four-bedroom house as a middle-class family with a mother, father and two children.  We had plenty of social circles.  The parents worked.  The children attended school and after-school activities.  We didn’t move around all the time.  We did not request government or social services that may have shined a light on our family dysfunction.  Nobody suspected anything.  We seemed like a “normal” family.

                My parents, uncles and grandparents started sexually abusing me when I was 2 years old.  This was necessary to break me.  I was indoctrinated in to a way of life. I was brainwashed.  But there was a problem.  As I got older, they realized I was a talker.  They had not successfully broken me.  I was telling people.  The good news for them … nobody believed me.  Or if they did, they didn’t do enough to help me.  I was visited by social services a few times.  My father had to threaten a few people to shut them up.  But in the end, my family maintained the secrecy … and control.</p>
            <p>My talking (and fighting back) led to some additional abuse.  My father became physically abusive with me.  I was suffocated, physically assaulted, abandoned, strangled, starved and hit many times in the head.  I went to the hospital on multiple occasions.  I am not sure how my father talked his way through those visits.  But he did.</p>
<p>
    By the age of 9, I was fully indoctrinated.  I had given up.  I remember the moment when I realized there was no hope of being saved from this terrible life.  In that moment, I made a conscious choice to forget.  Not only did I forget my abusive past, but I forgot every abusive experience in the coming years.  I could forget almost instantaneously.  Dissociation is a powerful defense mechanism.  And it is a common response to trauma.

My parents divorced, but my mother continued the abuse and trafficking.  She continued to sell me to pimps to make money and justified it by blaming me for her divorce.  When she remarried, my stepfather became my next abuser.  He used financial control to keep me quiet by threatening to leave us homeless if I did not comply with his wishes.  In high school, I acted from a dissociated state most of the time.  I was bullied all the time because I did not know how to stand up for myself with my peers.  But at home, I was no longer interested in keeping the peace.  I acted like many teenagers do when they are trying to push limits.  I fought back intensely which caused my parents to raise the bar on the level of abuse.  There were many times I was sure I would die, but somehow, I stayed alive.
